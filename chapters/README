...

For example, if you were creating a book, then you could have chapters like this:

01_preface.md
02_introduction.md
03_why_markdown_is_useful.md
04_limitations_of_markdown.md
05_conclusions.md
You can merge them by doing executing this command within the same directory:

pandoc *.md > markdown_book.html
Since pandoc will merge all the files prior to doing the translation, you can include your links in the last file like this:

01_preface.md
02_introduction.md
03_why_markdown_is_useful.md
04_limitations_of_markdown.md
05_conclusions.md
06_links.md
So part of your 01_preface.md could look like this:

I always wanted to write a book with [markdown][mkdnlink].
And part of your 02_introduction.md could look like this:

Let's start digging into [the best text-based syntax][mkdnlink] available.
As long as your last file includes the line:

[mkdnlink]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown
...the same command used before will perform the merge and conversion while including that link throughout. Just make sure you leave a blank line or two at the beginning of that file. The pandoc documentation says that it adds a blank line between files that are merged this way, but this didn't work for me without the blank line.
