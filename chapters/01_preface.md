#Preface

In this book we'll be covering rapid prototyping from the perspective of the front-end developer (although designers, managers, etc., will probably get a lot out of the content too). The approach will favor using a tool-based approach and be aimed more towards the developer with minimal design ability. We are not advocating getting rid of old approaches, but simply adding a newer and faster one to our repetoire.

The pace of the book will be quite fast as we'll favor brevity so we can dig deeper in to "doing" and cover more materials. Therefore, we'll be making heavy use of web links to places to get more detailed coverage on topics we might seem to breeze past.

**Programming Language and Syntaxes**

Most of the examples will be in some type of language or syntax familiar to front-end developers. In addition we will learn some tool-specific syntaxes:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
* [Compass][compass] and [Sass][sass] (the .scss version) and possibly a bit of [LESS][less]
* Tool specific syntaxes (e.g. [Grunt][grunt], [Bower][bower], [Yeoman][yeoman], etc.)
* Command line

**Assumptions**

This book assumes experience with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Resources**

I've generally listed any resources as clickable web links that you can learn more from, or, as links to where you might purchase the book that I'm referencing.

**Line breaks in code**

I've taken the liberty of purposely wrapping long lines that won't fit within the width of the page.

**Contributions**

I am definitely open to collaborative authorship (hey, I did put it on github!), provided that other authors follow the general style and spirit of the book. At some point, I'll try to define this all in a more concrete way. If you do want to contribute, you'll probably want to have a good look at the commented Makefile, and also notice the use of "extra lines" between code samples. I've managed to find workarounds for the somewhat finicky pandoc/docbook tool-chain (and I'm thankful that it works at all since these tools really make life so much easier!)

**Special acknowledgement**

I feel obliged to commend [Addy Osmani][addy] on his countless community contributions, particularly in developer education, and would like to acknowledge that seeing the impact of his work is part of what inspired me to write works like this myself. If you haven't already, you should check out his book: [Essential JS Design Patterns][addybook] is where I shamelessly lifted the pandoc build process being used here!
