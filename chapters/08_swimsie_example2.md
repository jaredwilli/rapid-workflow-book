# Swimsie.com

TBD - the swimsie.com stuff will probably span at least a couple of chapters. Won't be able to define the topics exactly until I know a bit more about what we'll be doing. But it will of course be "example-driven" and will primarily be front-end stuff (I don't plan to go in to any stuff like back-end coding for a REST Api or express/node.js, etc. .... it will be all front end).
