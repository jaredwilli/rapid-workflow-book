**Why rapid prototyping?**

Many projects for the web go from the meeting room, to a wireframing tool or sketch pad, and then quickly move to the Adobe Creative Suite where high fidelity mocks are created. Then, these mocks must be painfully sliced and diced in to assets. Finally, a front-end developer meticulously hand crafts "pixel-perfect" pages ready for web consumption. While getting pristine looking sites may still involve some of these steps, we now have quicker alternatives.

Frameworks like [HTML5 Boilerplate][html5b], [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap], and Zurb's [Foundation][foundation] make it ridiculously easy to quickly put together acceptable web page prototypes. Even more full-blown workflow tools like [Yeoman][yeoman] can integrate, not just rapid prototyping, but also things like library updates, testing, image optimization, deployment, etc.

Once prototyped, we're able to either iterate further customizing our pages in to truly unique and beautiful ones, or scrap the whole idea and start over. Today, the ability to ["fail-fast"][failfast] but then get right back in the game is [key][failfast2]), and the rapid prototyping approach we'll be discussing allows you to do so.

So, there you have it, my elevator pitch on why rapid prototyping is so important. Yes, a lot more could be said (see section below), but I'll purposely depart early from any sort of long-winded persuasive argument so we can get to the fun stuff..."doing".

**More info please!**

Erica Heinz gave a nice presentation on utilizing rapid prototyping which is quite persuasive. Here are her [slides][ericaheinz-deck].

Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden are advocating a somewhat similar approach to UX which they call [LeanUX][leanux-smashing]. Also see these [slides][leanux-slides].

Here's a nice [slide-deck][skip-wireframe] which proposes ditching wireframing alltogether using [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] to prototype a responsive web site.
