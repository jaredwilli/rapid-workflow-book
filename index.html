<h1><a href="#TOC">Preface</a></h1>
<p>In this book we’ll be covering rapid prototyping from the perspective of the front-end developer (although designers, managers, etc., will probably get a lot out of the content too). The approach will favor using a tool-based approach and be aimed more towards the developer with minimal design ability. We are not advocating getting rid of old approaches, but simply adding a newer and faster one to our repetoire.</p>
<p>The pace of the book will be quite fast as we’ll favor brevity so we can dig deeper in to <q>doing</q> and cover more materials. Therefore, we’ll be making heavy use of web links to places to get more detailed coverage on topics we might seem to breeze past.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Language and Syntaxes</strong></p>
<p>Most of the examples will be in some type of language or syntax familiar to front-end developers. In addition we will learn some tool-specific syntaxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> and <a href="sass-lang.com">Sass</a> (the .scss version) and possibly a bit of <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a></li>
<li>Tool specific syntaxes (e.g. <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>, <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>, etc.)</li>
<li>Command line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>This book assumes experience with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>I’ve generally listed any resources as clickable web links that you can learn more from, or, as links to where you might purchase the book that I’m referencing.</p>
<p><strong>Line breaks in code</strong></p>
<p>I’ve taken the liberty of purposely wrapping long lines that won’t fit within the width of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>
<p>I am definitely open to collaborative authorship (hey, I did put it on github!), provided that other authors follow the general style and spirit of the book. At some point, I’ll try to define this all in a more concrete way. If you do want to contribute, you’ll probably want to have a good look at the commented Makefile, and also notice the use of <q>extra lines</q> between code samples. I’ve managed to find workarounds for the somewhat finicky pandoc/docbook tool-chain (and I’m thankful that it works at all since these tools really make life so much easier!)</p>
<p><strong>Special acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>I feel obliged to commend <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/">Addy Osmani</a> on his countless community contributions, particularly in developer education, and would like to acknowledge that seeing the impact of his work is part of what inspired me to write works like this myself. If you haven’t already, you should check out his book: <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">Essential JS Design Patterns</a> is where I shamelessly lifted the pandoc build process being used here!</p>

<section class="level1" id="introduction">
<h1><a href="#TOC">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><strong>Why rapid prototyping?</strong></p>
<p>Many projects for the web go from the meeting room, to a wireframing tool or sketch pad, and then quickly move to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite">Adobe Creative Suite</a> where high fidelity mocks are created. Then, these mocks must be painfully sliced and diced in to assets. Finally, a front-end developer meticulously hand crafts <q>pixel-perfect</q> pages ready for web consumption. While getting pristine looking sites may still involve some of these steps, we now have quicker alternatives.</p>
<p>Frameworks like <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and Zurb’s <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> make it ridiculously easy to quickly put together acceptable web page prototypes. Even more full-blown workflow tools like <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> can integrate—not just rapid prototyping—but also things like library updating, image optimization, compression, minification, deployment, etc.</p>
<p>Once we’ve got an initial prototype of our web site, we can choose to iterate further, fully customizing it, or, scrap the whole idea and go back to the drawing board. The ability for lean start-ups to <a href="http://www.canrockventures.com/fail-often-fail-fast-fail-cheap/"><q>fail-fast</q></a>, pivot, adapt, get to market fast, etc., are all <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-06-24/fail-fast-fail-cheap">key</a>. The rapid prototyping approach we’ll be discussing in this book provides some tools to help the developer to cope with these time sensitive realities.</p>
<p>So, there you have it, my elevator pitch on why rapid prototyping is an important addition to your tool kit. Yes, a lot more could be said (see links in the section below), but I’ll purposely depart early from any sort of long-winded persuasive argument so we can get to the fun stuff…<q>doing</q>.</p>
<p><strong>More info please!</strong></p>
<p>Erica Heinz gave a nice presentation on utilizing rapid prototyping which is quite persuasive. Here are her <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ericaheinz/rapid-prototyping-rough-to-ready">slides</a>.</p>
<p>Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden are advocating an approach to UX which they call <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/">LeanUX</a>. Also see these <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jgothelf/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business">slides</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a nice <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jjeffryes/rapid-and-responsive-skip-the-wireframe">slide-deck</a> which proposes ditching wireframing altogether to instead use <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to prototype a responsive web site.</p>
<p><strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong></p>
<p>Every front-end developer has that perfect combination of tools and libraries that he or she uses to improve workflow. Sometimes its that special combination of plugins to trick out their favorite editor or IDE (e.g. the perfect Vim, Sublime Text, or WebStorm set up); sometimes its an assortment of custom shell scripts; sometimes its a certain combination of libraries that all projects get started with, etc. As we continue to learn of new tools, libraries, and best practices, we further pepper our set ups. But it turns out to be <em>really hard</em> to keep up with <q>the cool kids</q>. This is why an <em>opinionated tool</em> such as Yeoman helps out so much. We’re greeted with an assortment of battle-tested components that help us maintain best practices while speeding up our workflow. But we do need to do a bit of homework ourselves to really benefit…or do we?</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com">netmagazine.com</a>, Paul Irish, one of the core developers of Yeoman, addresses an interesting question regarding the use of libraries we don’t fully understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><q>…there’s a common sentiment that says: <q>If you don’t know how something works, you shouldn’t use it.</q> JavaScript libraries serve a purpose of papering over browser APIs to create a much more functional API to interface with. But these libraries sit on top of the browser so, if we take the same argument that says you shouldn’t use something you don’t [understand], are we going to apply that to the entire browser as well? It’s hard to say that you should understand the entirety of the browser before you use it,</q> he adds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, we want to generally understand <q>what’s going on</q>, but we don’t want to get so offtrack with researching how things work that we completely sideline our current projects. We have to strike a balance.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Yeoman tool itself has so many sub-components, that only the most seasoned front-end developer will come to it understanding them all. It’s easy to feel bit overwhelmed at first. One of the goals of this book is to help the reader understand some of these tools individually so they can use workflow tools like Yeoman more effectively.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
<li>Compass/Sass</li>
<li>Modernizr</li>
<li>RequireJS</li>
<li>JSHint</li>
<li>OptiPNG and JPEGTran</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course we’ll look at Grunt and Bower (both of which are now part of Yeoman 1.0 itself). Once you’ve got a handle on these tools, you may later choose to, say, swap Zurb Foundation in place of Twitter Bootstrap, LESS for Sass, etc. But the general philosophy and approach will be close enough to what you’ve learned that you’ll be able to do so confidently.</p>
<p><em>Please be forwarned that we won’t be going extremely <q>deep</q> on these tools but, rather, we will provide enough of an introduction to gain a general understanding of what the tool does and how to get started with it. You should plan to consult each tool’s documentation for in depth coverage.</em></p>

<section class="level1" id="setting-up">
<h1><a href="#TOC">Setting up</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we’ll briefly introduce CSS preprocessors (<a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, <a href="sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, etc.), <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and end with a look at a full-blown workflow tool called <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a CSS preprocessor and why should I use one?</li>
<li>What are Compass and Sass?</li>
<li>What exactly is Twitter Bootstrap and how can I benefit from it?</li>
<li>What is Yeoman, and how can it help my rapid prototyping workflow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss some of the core tools we’ll be using throughout the remainder of this book…</p>
<section class="level3" id="what-is-a-css-preprocessor">
<h3><a href="#TOC">What is a CSS preprocessor?</a></h3>
<p>A CSS preprocessor is simply a tool that takes text you’ve written in the preprocessor’s language (usually a super-set of CSS), and converts it into valid CSS. Because the preprocessor language is, essentially a super-set of CSS, it adds useful mechanisms such as variables, nesting, mixins, basic math, etc.</p>
<p>Just taking the variable feature, for example, you might define a color variable in one place and then reference it later as needed:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css">$dark<span class="dv">:</span> <span class="fl">#333</span>;
<span class="fl">...</span>
<span class="fl">.foo</span> <span class="kw">{</span> <span class="kw">background-color:</span> $dark <span class="kw">}</span>
<span class="fl">.bar</span> <span class="kw">{</span> <span class="kw">background-color:</span> $dark <span class="kw">}</span>
<span class="fl">.baz</span> <span class="kw">{</span> <span class="kw">background-color:</span> $dark <span class="kw">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Later, if you decide you’d like $dark to be, well, a bit darker, you could simply redefine the initial declaration like so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css">$dark<span class="dv">:</span> <span class="fl">#191919</span>;</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>.foo</code>, <code>.bar</code>, and <code>.baz</code> will all be updated to use the new background-color the next time your .scss file is converted to CSS.</p>
<p>I’d be remiss not to mention that the three most popular CSS preprocessors today are LESS, Sass, and Stylus. All have their <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/2013/03/less-vs-sass-vs-stylus/">merits</a> but we’ll primarily be using Sass in this book.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="why-use-a-css-preprocessor">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Why use a CSS preprocessor?</a></h3>
<p>If you’ve done much web development, you’re already aware that CSS can get unruly fast! Using a preprocessor affords a nice means of keeping CSS organized and maintainable. This point is best proven by example—so let’s move on to discussing Sass.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="what-is-sass">
<h3><a href="#TOC">What is Sass?</a></h3>
<p>Sass is an open source tool that allows its metalanguage—also called Sass—to be interpreted into CSS. It has two syntaxes, <code>.sass</code> and <code>.scss</code>. We’ll only be covering the <code>.scss</code> syntax which is a super set of CSS that provides conveniences such as: variables, nesting, mixins, selector inheritance, and much more. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">[1]</a> In a bit, we’ll examine exactly what those mechanisms are and how they work. But for now, let’s take a look at Sass’s complimentary technology Compass. <a href="http://www.manning.com/netherland/SaCiA_meap_ch01.pdf">[2]</a></p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="what-is-compass">
<h3><a href="#TOC">What is Compass?</a></h3>
<p>Compass is a combination of things. It’s a workflow tool for Sass that sets up relative paths (such as the relative path to your images via the image_url property; it does this via a config.rb configuration file). It then <q>watches</q> changes you make in your .scss files compiling those in to valid CSS. Compass also provides is a vast library of reusable Sass mixins for grids, tables, lists, CSS3, and more. Lastly, Compass is a full scope platform for building frameworks and extensions. <a href="http://chriseppstein.github.io/blog/2009/09/30/what-is-compass/">[3]</a></p>
<p>Again, we’ll be going over how to use Compass in more detail soon, but first let’s have a quick look at Twitter Bootstrap…</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="twitter-bootstrap-not-just-a-css-framework">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Twitter Bootstrap: Not just a CSS framework!</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is an open source framework that contains a set of CSS boiler plate templates for typography, buttons, charts, forms, tables, navigation and layout, etc. This CSS depends on a small set of HTML class name conventions such that any web author can <q>hook into</q> these styles by simply providing the proper markup. It also features a 12-column responsive grid so your site can adapt to different devices. It’s currently the most popular GitHub project and used by big hitters such as NASA and MSNBC. <a href="http://builtwithbootstrap.com/post/15403007616/code-nasa-from-the-real-nasa-via">[4]</a></p>
<p>In addition to interface components, the Bootstrap framework provides a plethora of JavaScript plugins that support dynamic UI components such as Modal, Tab, Tooltip, Popover, Alert, Carousel, Typeahead, Dropdown, and more. It’s only real dependency is <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="setting-up-for-development">
<h2><a href="#TOC">Setting Up For Development</a></h2>
<p>In this section we will be setting the stage for things to come by installing Compass/Sass, Twitter Bootstrap and any other dependencies along the way. We’ll first show how you to set up some of the tools individually, and then show how you can do it all at once with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>. If you’re already sure you want to use <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> feel free to skip to that section (but first ensure you have <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> installed).</p>
<p>In this section we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Compass and Sass</li>
<li>Installing Twitter Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
<section class="level3" id="installing-ruby">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Installing Ruby</a></h3>
<p>In order to use Compass and Sass you’ll need to first install Ruby. If you’re on OS X you already have it. For Linux users I’m going to assume you’re adept enough on the command line to get Ruby installed yourself. Windows users can download an <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">executable installer</a>.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="installing-compass-and-sass">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Installing Compass and Sass</a></h3>
<p>With that done, you should be able to open a command line and use the <code>gem</code> command. If you install Compass you get Sass installed for free. You’ll need to use the command line terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ gem <span class="kw">install</span> compass</code></pre>
<p><strong>Linux / OS X</strong></p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">sudo</span> gem <span class="kw">install</span> compass</code></pre>
<p><strong>OS X GUI Installer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac, you can optionally use Chris Eppstein’s <a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/downloads">graphical installer package</a></p>
<p><strong>Sass Only</strong></p>
<p>If for some reason don’t want to install Compass you can install Sass individually as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ gem <span class="kw">install</span> sass</code></pre>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="installing-twitter-bootstrap">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Installing Twitter Bootstrap</a></h3>
<p>If you already have extensive experience with Bootstrap and just want to get on with using Sass to customize Bootstrap, you may choose to skip (or perhaps skim) this section.</p>
<p>Before combining technologies such as Bootstrap and Sass, it’s useful to play with them in isolation to get a better understanding of how they work. In that spirit, let’s download a <q>vanilla version</q> of Bootstrap (not adapted for Sass) and have some fun. <em>Don’t worry, we’ll soon get to using things like Yeoman, sass-bootstrap, etc.</em></p>
<p>There are a couple ways to get Bootstrap. One is simply to go to their site and download the zip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a></li>
<li>Click the huge <strong>Download Bootstrap</strong> button</li>
<li>Extract the downloaded file and ensure you see the <code>css</code>, <code>img</code>, and <code>js</code> directories</li>
<li>Go to the Twitter Bootstrap <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/getting-started.html#examples">examples page</a></li>
<li>Right-click any of the examples you’d like to play with and <q>Save Link As</q></li>
<li>Save the .html file to the top level of the same directory you extracted Bootstrap to</li>
<li>Open the .html file in an editor and search for: <code>../assets/</code> and replace with empty string (empty string…as in blank!)</li>
</ul>
<p>This should have found any link or src tags with relative paths like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;link</span><span class="ot"> href=</span><span class="st">&quot;../assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.css&quot;</span><span class="ot"> rel=</span><span class="st">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>and replaced them with relative paths that look like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;link</span><span class="ot"> href=</span><span class="st">&quot;css/bootstrap-responsive.css&quot;</span><span class="ot"> rel=</span><span class="st">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now double click that file and it should look as it did when you previewed it on their web site. If you’re unfamiliar with Twitter Bootstrap, feel free to start hacking away off that static file now, or skip to the exercises section below.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="alternate-install">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Alternate Install</a></h3>
<p>If you’re more of the command line type you’ve probably already cloned their repo, but if not try this (you’ll need to have and internet connection and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">cd</span> bootstrap <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> npm <span class="kw">install</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">make</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">make</span> <span class="kw">test</span></code></pre>
<p>That will clone the Bootstrap repository, put you in the cloned directory, install all the node packages that Bootstrap requires, build Bootstrap’s LESS files, compile it’s documentation, etc., and run the full test suite…whew!</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you happen to have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> and Twitter’s package manager <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> installed you might just do:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ bower <span class="kw">install</span> bootstrap .</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve elected to use one of these command line methods to download Bootstrap, you should still go download an example .html file from the Twitter Bootstrap Examples page and ensure you can get it to render properly on your local system by replacing any invalid relative paths. Then do the exercises that follow.</p>

<section class="level3" id="scout">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Scout</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/">Scout</a> is a simple GUI that sits on top of <a href="http://get.adobe.com/air/">Adobe Air</a>. Download the Scout <a href="http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/">installer</a> for either OS X or Windows and simply follow the instructions to get it installed. Start a new project by opening up Scout and clicking the plus sign on the lower left, then navigate to the directory you’d like to create your project in. Once you’ve selected a directory and clicked <q>Open</q>, you’re new project will show up in Scout on the left side.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/Scout-App2.png" title="Opening a project in Scout " alt="Opening a project in Scout"><figcaption>Opening a project in Scout</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Above, I’ve created a folder called <q>Scout</q>. As you can see, we’re required to select the input and output folders. However, we haven’t set those yet…let’s do so.</p>
<p>In your project directory (the <code>Scout</code> directory in the above example), manually create the following directory structure and files (you’ll use <code>compass create</code> to do much the same later but let’s do it manually for now):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">|</span>-- css
<span class="kw">|</span>-- index.html
<span class="kw">|</span>-- sass
    <span class="kw">|</span>-- style.scss</code></pre>
<p>Above we have two directories <code>css</code> and <code>sass</code> and two files <code>index.html</code> and <code>sass/style.scss</code>. The <code>index.html</code> file should contain:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="er">&lt;</span>!doctype html&gt;
<span class="kw">&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;</span>Compass Sass Sandbox<span class="kw">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;link</span><span class="ot"> href=</span><span class="st">&quot;css/style.css&quot;</span><span class="ot"> rel=</span><span class="st">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><span class="ot"> type=</span><span class="st">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="kw">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>This is a test.<span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>And the <code>sass/style.scss</code> file should contain:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css"><span class="dv">@import</span> <span class="st">&quot;compass/reset&quot;</span><span class="dv">;</span>
$testColor<span class="dv">:</span> <span class="fl">#008080</span>;
<span class="fl">.test</span> <span class="kw">{</span>
    <span class="kw">color:</span> $testColor<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre>
<p>It should be self-evident in the above <code>.scss</code> file that we’re importing Compass’s reset module, defining a color variable, and then using that variable on the <code>.test</code> class we defined earlier in our markup.</p>
<p>Now go back to the Scout application. For the <q>Input Folder</q> click the <q>Choose</q> button and find the <code>sass</code> directory we defined earlier; now do the same for the <q>Output Folder</q> but this time choose the <code>css</code> directory. The idea here is that the input files will get fetched from the <code>sass</code> directory (where we have our <code>.scss</code> files), get converted to proper CSS, and then output as <code>.css</code> files to the our output directory.</p>
<p>Once you’ve set up the input and output folders, simply click the big <q>play button</q> beside your project name to start Scout <q>watching</q> for file modifications. The first time I did this it took several seconds before I actually saw the output on the log tab showing that the style.scss file was detected and the style.css file was created:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/Scout-Compiled2.png" title="Scout can convert your .scss files to .css files" alt="Scout can convert your .scss files to .css files"><figcaption>Scout can convert your .scss files to .css files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If for some reason you don’t see this try re-saving your style.scss file to force Scout to compile it.</p>
<p>At this point you should be able to double click on the project’s index.html file and see <q>This is a test in teal</q>. Not too exciting yet—I know—but we’ve now seen a simple Compass/Sass workflow using Scout. Try making a few more edits to the .scss file and you’ll see that Scout detects them and recompiles a new modified .css file for you. Nice!</p>
<p>While your at it, be sure to have a quick look at the generated CSS file. Now try removing the Compass reset import line and see what’s generated. You should see all of the boiler-plate reset CSS was removed (as expected), and just see the changes made on the <code>.test</code> class. Our Sass changes are reflected immediately in the corresponding CSS file.</p>

<h2><a href="#TOC">Yeoman</a></h2>
<p>If you’re a CLI junky looking to fully optimize your front-end set up, you might want to take a look at <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>. Yeoman is spearheaded by none other than <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/">Addy Osmani</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus</a>. Yeoman bundles <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Bower</a>, <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> (and much more) in to one very convenient command line tool. It is still in BETA, so don’t use unless you’re <q>adventurous</q>. That said, the author has had success using Yeoman since version 1.0 was released a few months before writing this guide. We’ll be using Yeoman to do all our heavy lifting through-out the remainder of this book.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> already installed, you should be able to get Yeoman up and running with the following commands:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> myproject <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">cd</span> <span class="ot">$_</span> <span class="co"># $_ is last argument of previous command</span>
$ npm <span class="kw">install</span> -g yo grunt-cli bower <span class="co"># -g installs these globally</span>
$ yo <span class="co"># Read the usage and then do Control-C to exit</span>
$ yo webapp <span class="co"># answer any questions and hit ENTER</span>
$ npm <span class="kw">install</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> bower <span class="kw">install</span>
$ grunt server</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you’ll have a fully prepared web app scaffolded and should be previewing your web app in a web browser. When you ran the <code>yo webapp</code> command, one of the questions you were asked should have looked something like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">Would you like to include Twitter Bootstrap <span class="kw">for</span> Sass? <span class="kw">(</span>Y/n<span class="kw">)</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s optionally setting up a Twttier Bootstrap port to Sass for us. Well, isn’t that nice! Yeoman makes it incredibly convenient to set up Compass/Sass based projects fast.</p>
<p>You can further adapt a project like this using one of the primary Yeoman tools which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yo—a tool for customizing projects and generating scaffolding</li>
<li>Grunt—you can use Grunt to create custom workflows for testing, deployment, coding standards verification, etc.</li>
<li>Bower—use Bower to install and/or updated your front-end packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you notice the <code>yo webapp</code> part back when we initiated our Yeoman project? In Yeoman parlance, that <code>webapp</code> thing is called a <em>generator</em>. The <code>webapp</code> generator is installed for us by default, but other generators you might want to use require you to install them yourself. You can do that via <a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a> (that stands for <em>node package manager</em> and it’s bundled with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>).</p>
<p>New generators are being added all the time, but at the time of writing this, the Yeoman docs list the following <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator">officially supported generators</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web App (comes by default)</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>Backbone</li>
<li>BBB (Backbone Boilerplate)</li>
<li>Chrome Apps Basic Boilerplate</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Jasmine</li>
<li>Mocha</li>
<li>Karma</li>
</ul>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, any generator besides the built in <code>webapp</code> generator needs to be installed separately. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ npm <span class="kw">install</span> -g generator-bbb <span class="co"># -g installs the bbb generator globally</span>
$ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> myproject <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kw">cd</span> <span class="ot">$_</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> yo bbb
$ grunt <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> grunt <span class="kw">test</span> <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> grunt server</code></pre>
<p>That would install the <a href="http://backboneboilerplate.com/">Backbone Boilerplate</a> generator, create a project, and then build, test, and preview it.</p>
<p>The above example workflows are just a couple ways you might use Yeoman to scaffold out a web app. Visit the <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman site</a> (or the author’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL56psyY4UDqNPWpTwpqtuIqNZwyQVBByb">How To Code</a> Youtube channel which has several tutorials on using Yeoman) to get more information on this lovely tool.</p>

<h2><a href="#TOC">Exercises</a></h2>
<p>Here are some easy exercises to get yourself familiarized with Bootstrap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a quick read through of the Twitter Bootstrap documentation which is only a half dozen pages or so. Don’t worry about memorizing every last detail; just try to get a general feel for where they cover what, what’s available, conventions they use, etc.—you’ll be visiting these docs frequently</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven’t already used Twitter Bootstrap before also do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the skeleton app we created above (in the section on Scout), and add jQuery and Bootstrap (in that order). The goal is to get a simple static page assembled with a form, table, and perhaps a navigation bar. Alternatively, if you’ve installed <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> you can create a similar file structure with the command: <code>compass create</code>. You will still have to create the <code>index.html</code> file though, so again, refer to the Scout section above for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>For guidance on how to refactor the simple index.html page example, first have a look at the <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/getting-started.html#examples">Getting Started</a> page * Also have a a look at the Layouts section for guidance on how to control your widths and flow * See the Base CSS section for guidance on forms and tables * See the Navbar docs for guidance on the navigation bar</p>
<p><em>If you’re more of a visual learner see the author’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEpMzpieTBg">video</a> for an example</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve installed Yeoman and/or Compass, and you’re adventurous, try adding a few <code>mixins</code> as described in <a href="http://culttt.com/2013/02/18/getting-started-with-compass/">this tutorial</a> on getting started with Compass. But don’t worry, this is <q>extra credit</q>—you can of course wait until we properly discuss Compass and Sass later in the book.</li>
</ul>
